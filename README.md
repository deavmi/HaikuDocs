HaikuDocs
=========

The current documentation for the Haiku User Guide is not easy to edit at all so I thought to myself, _"Why not just write new and up-to-date documentation in Markdown and publish it to a git repository so that people can finally easily contribute to it?"_ So I did just that and look where we are now.
