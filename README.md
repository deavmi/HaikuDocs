HaikuDocs
=========

## What is the point of the project?

The current documentation for the Haiku User Guide is not easy to edit at all so I thought to myself, "Why not just write a new and up-to-date documentation in Markdown and publish it to a git repository so that people can finally easily contribute to it?"
