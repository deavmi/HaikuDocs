============

Please follow these guidelines when working on this project; if they are unclear then create an issue on GitHub for your question and we can sort out your problem and make this document better.

* Make sure you commit to the branch of the language if you are working on a page in that language.
    * If the branch for the language of your document does not exist then create an issue for it on GitHub and it will be created as soon as possible.
* When adding a new page please follow the directory structure; it is pretty self-explanatory.
    * Make sure it is also added to the _Table of Contents_
* Make sure you take good quality screenshots
    * Crop screenshots as much as possible to the window (or whatever) being screenshotted.
    * Also, make the background of the screenshot either transparent (preferred) or white.
    * Screenshots are to be stored in the `img/` directory of the thing being documented.
* You can use whatever Markdown editor you want to but when creating HTML files for the website documentation you must export them using Retext as your Markdown editor as the style is generates them in is the standard used here.
* Take a look at [`TEMPLATE.md`](TEMPLATE.md) and follow its style but also actually look at the source code of the Markdown in that file.
* If you have made a contribution then make sure to add yourself to the [`ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md`](ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md) file.
* And have fun! ;)
