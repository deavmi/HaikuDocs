Contributing
============

Please follow these guidelines when working on this project; if they are unclear then create an issue on GitHub for your question and we can sort out your problem and make this document better.

* Make sure you commit to the branch of the language if you are working on a page in that language.
    * If the branch for the language of your document does not exist then create an issue for it on GitHub and it will be created as soon as possible.
* When adding a new page please follow the directory structure; it is pretty self-explanatory.
    * Make sure it is also added to the _Table of Contents_
* Make sure you take good quality screenshots
    * Crop screenshots as much as possible to the window (or whatever) being screenshotted.
    * Also, make the background of the screenshot either transparent (preferred) or white.
    * Screenshots are to be stored in the `img/` directory of the thing being documented.
* Take a look at [`TEMPLATE.md`](TEMPLATE.md) and follow its style but also actually look at the source code of the Markdown in that file. Take a look at [`docs/bundledSoftware/SoftwareUpdater/README.md`](docs/bundledSoftware/SoftwareUpdater/README.md) for the layout of what your document should look like.
* If you have made a contribution then make sure to add yourself to the [`ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md`](ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md) file.
* And have fun! ;)
